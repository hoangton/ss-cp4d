Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}. 

To learn more about the release, try:

  $ helm status {{ .Release.Name }}
  $ helm get all {{ .Release.Name }}

To check the deployment status, run:
  $ CLUSTER_NAME=$(helm get values -a  -o json {{ .Release.Name }} | jq -r '.memsqlCluster.name')
  $ oc get memsqlcluster ${CLUSTER_NAME} -o=jsonpath='{.status.phase}{"\n"}'
When the above command's output value is "Running", it means the SingleStore DB server deployment is finished

Run:
  $ oc get svc | grep ${CLUSTER_NAME}
It will show two services:
  svc-${CLUSTER_NAME}-ddl
  svc-${CLUSTER_NAME}-dml
Use MySQL compatible client to connect to the two service end points.
